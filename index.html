<h2>Description</h2>



<p> The goal of <em>Astronomia Olímpica</em> is to remedy the lack of Astronomy related materials in Brazil, especially for Astronomy Olympiads. It was written as the primary text for high-school students taking part in the selection process for IOAA (International) and OLAA (Latin-American), but anyone who loves astronomy shall have a ball with it. Though there are more than 100 pages dedicated to mathematical methods (basic math, dimensional analysis, approximations, and scientific calculator), it is strongly recommended to have a solid high-school foundation in math for extracting the most from the book. With almost 500 pages, the 7 chapters and 8 appendixes cover all the main topics of Astronomy Olympiads, such as telescopes, binary systems, time scales and positional astronomy. </p>



<p> The list of authors and reviewers of each chapter may be found on section "Créditos e Contato" in the beginning of the book. The reviewer was responsible for repairing grammatical/algebrical mistakes and remaking texts and images to ensure that the book is homogeneous (being hard to realize that there were several authors). Index:</p>


<ul>
<li>"Teoria": author of theory</li>
<li>"Probs.": author of problems in the end of chapter</li>
<li>"Revisão": reviewer of both theory and problems</li>
</ul>


<h2>Content</h2>



<p> There are 7 chapters and 8 appendixes. Each chapter has around 10 problems in the end, all with solutions, and several solved examples throughout the theory. Each appendix covers a short topic and is also accompanied by solved examples. </p>
